test_client/

These are sanity tests for Test::XTracker::Client. Many of the methods in it
are shared, and it's often useful just to slightly modify an existing method
than write your own; works fine until you break someone else's page definition.

Each of these tests work against a hard-coded HTML page, rather than a going
and finding the content dynamically. This works well for testing refactoring
of Client.pm, and badly for testing changes to templates. It does keep these
tests - tests of the test-suite such as they are - light, fast, easy to write
and very useful for quickly checking you didn't break something.
