==================

Last updated: 06 August 2010

"t/TEST" is a wrapper around an instance of Apache,
intended to be used in tests.

t/10-env

    Tests which cover the setup of the environment.
    All test harness call this.

t/20-units

    Unit tests, where a "unti" is the "smallest testable part of an
    application" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)
    That's the aspiration for making life easier; the reality is
    rather messy: please help improve it.

t/30-functional

    Functional tests that cover larger aspects of the application,
    where "aspect" is "a part of a programme that cross-cuts its core
    concerns ... a feature linked to many parts of a program 
    [though]... not necessarily the primary function of a program." 
    (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_(computer_science))
    That's the aspiration for making life easier; the reality is
