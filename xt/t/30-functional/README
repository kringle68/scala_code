Documentation can be found in the POD for every test.

There is a separate test in t/10-env that ensures every 30-functional test has POD.

The tests are organised by team, with files that aren't only the responsibility
of either CANDO or WHM going into 'other' directory:

t/30-functional
  \___cando
  \___warehouse
  \___other - not clearly either cando or warehouse's sole responsibility
  \___class - Test::Class hierarchy, we're not able to split this up by directory
