XT 2010.24.11 Deployment Instructions
=====================================

PACKAGES TO INSTALL:

XTracker:

* Package: xt 
* Version: 2010.24.11-0
* Location: cfmaster.dave:/var/www/html/netaporter/dev_releases/x86_64/xt-2010.24.11-0.x86_64.rpm

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:

* rpm has changed to start amq consumer daemon differently - 
    
     Please pay special attention

     There may be errors when it tries to stop something that 
     does not exist yet, though this is not necessarily a problem 

     ps -ef | grep active 

     Is script/xt_activemq_dc_daemon.pl running as nobody 
     (and only once)

BARCODE SCANNER:
(not sure if this is still relevant for the point release but leaving in just in case)

Extra useful information from Andrew Millar:

  hey guys

  So the scanner reader.pl which may need restarting is possibly broken,
  in which case you'll need to run /root/scanner_reader.pl instead.

  If the old scanner_reader.pl running from /tmp is still going (ie it
  hasn't been restarted) then we should be all good - just keep an eye on 

  /opt/xt/deploy/xtracker/script/housekeeping/orders/scanner.log

  to make sure we're still getting the pings from the two scanners (the
  control character things).

DEPLOYMENT RECIPE:

These instructions assume the packages are in a repo the box can see.

* sudo yum clean all
* sudo yum update perl-nap -y
* sudo yum erase xt -y && sudo yum install xt -y

Installing the XT package _should_ apply the DB patches and restart 
all the required services. 

However, if this is on a new box, part of the install will fail due
to log file permission errors. If this happens, remove and install
the app again, and that should fix it.
