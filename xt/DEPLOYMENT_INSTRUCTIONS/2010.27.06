=====================================
XT 2010.27.06 Deployment Instructions
=====================================

Release Date:       2011-01-31

PACKAGES TO INSTALL:

XTracker:

* Package: xt
* Version: 2010.27.06
* Location: cfmaster.dave:/var/www/html/netaporter/dev_releases/x86_64/xt-2010.27.06-0.x86_64.rpm

These instructions assume the packages are in a repo the box can see.

* sudo yum clean all
* sudo yum update xt

Installing the XT package _should_ apply the DB patches and restart 
all the required services. 

However, if this is on a new box, part of the install will fail due
to log file permission errors. If this happens, remove and install
the app again, and that should fix it.
