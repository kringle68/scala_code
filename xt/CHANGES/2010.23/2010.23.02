h2. Bugs

    * REL-980: (live issue) Fixes to update 'orders.tender' Card Debit records when changes are made to shipping/prices etc.

h2. Projects

    * GV: Merge of Gift Voucher project code

    * DCEA: (to the special attention of MIS)

      - previously, the shipment_item_status_id of a shipment_item record could only assume the value "picked" once
      - now, it can transition from "picked" to "packing exception" (when the packer finds a problem with the item) to "picked" again (when the supervisor fixes the item in some way)

      - XTracker needs the ActiveMQ broker to talk to itself; it will use the queues called "dc1/xt_wms" and "dc1/ravni_wms" (and "dc2/*" in the other DC)
