 * Packing Process Changes
 ** Place Into Packing Exception (PIPE) page
 *** Whenever a shipment cannot be packed for any reason (it is on hold, items missing or faulty) the packer is instructed to scan all shipment items present into a new tote and send the tote to the Packing Exception Supervisor (PE-S) desk
 *** This will send the appropriate item_moved messages to IWS system (or Ravni)
 ** Place Into Packing Exception - Orphan (PIPEO) page
 *** Once no more shipments can be packed from a given tote, or set of totes, the packer is asked to confirm that the tote(s) are empty. If they observe that there are in fact items remaining (these may be cancelled or unexpected items) they are instructed to scan any remaining items into new totes and send them to THE PE-S desk

 * Packing Exception Desk Changes
 ** Packing Exception Screen overview
 *** The PE screen now shows a list of all shipments which require actioning and a list of all totes and unexpected items which have been send there for processing
 ** Packing Exception actions
 *** The PE-S is required to confirm the status of all faulty, missing and cancelled items in shipments.
 *** Faulty items are scanned out of the shipment tote and placed in quarantine, with appropriate IWS messages. Item status updated so new replacement stock is picked.
 *** Cancelled items are scanned out of the shipment tote to be returned to main stock as usual. Appropriate IWS messages also send here.
 *** Missing items have their status updated so new replacement stock is picked.
 ** Commissioner concept
 *** The commissioner will be a real place in the fully automated system, but in the short term is a place on the floor next to the PE-S where all totes are placed after the PE-S has dealt with them
 *** An operator with the appropriate permissions can view what the system believes to be in the commissioner and what action (if any) should be taken on those totes
 ** Retrieval from commissioner
 *** When replacement items reach the packer, if any other shipment items remain in the commissioner, they are prompted to retrieve them manually. In phase 2 this will happen automatically.
 *** If a commissioner tote(s) completely contain any packable shipment, the PE-S is prompted to send the totes to a packer.
